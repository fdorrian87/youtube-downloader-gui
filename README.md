# youtube-downloader-gui
A mini project of mine to practice creating simple GUIs with a blend of Customer TKInter, TKInter, and YT_DLP libraries

1. Alter the filepath in ln 9 with the location you want to save the video.
2. Save the file.
3. Run the program
4. Finally, simply copy and paste your desired YouTube video link into the specified field, and click the button - the program will download it in the best available quality
